# Risks & Open Decisions

## Top technical risks (from Codex review, 2026-07-29)

1. **Multi-passenger insertion complexity.** Mitigated in MVP by capping
   occurrences at 2 concurrent passenger parties + re-verify detour inside the
   accept transaction. Raising the cap needs a real insertion algorithm and more
   OSRM budget. Decide only with usage data.
2. **Push reliability.** Expo push is best-effort, duplicable, and tokens die
   silently. Mitigations are specced (outbox retries, idempotency keys, receipts,
   token pruning, reconcile-on-open) — but this needs deliberate testing, incl.
   killed-app and dozing-Android scenarios.
3. **OSRM real memory footprint.** "A few hundred MB" is an estimate, not a
   measurement. Action: build the Greek/prefecture extract on the mini PC and
   measure serving RSS **before** choosing the VPS plan.
4. **Cold-start liquidity** (product risk, the biggest one). Matching tech is
   worthless without drivers. Pilot plan: seed one corridor/community (e.g. one
   town ↔ one city), invite codes, personally onboard the first 20 drivers.

## Legal / privacy (needs a real check before public launch)

- **Cost-sharing vs commercial transport (Greek law).** The app must stay clearly
  non-commercial: suggested contribution ≤ actual cost share, no profit, no
  per-ride commission. Check KOK/transport rules + how BlaBlaCar operates in
  Greece as precedent. Until verified, copy stays conservative ("συνεισφορά στα
  έξοδα").
- **GDPR.** Precise location = personal data. Specced mitigations: no passive
  tracking, ephemeral live positions, 12-month retention + anonymization,
  region-level (not point-level) analytics. Still needs: privacy policy, consent
  screens, data-export/delete endpoints (GDPR arts. 15/17).
- **SMS OTP provider** choice affects cost + GDPR processor list.

## Open product decisions (decide during MVP build)

- Final name + domain (working name: carpool).
- Women-only matching toggle: MVP or fast-follow.
- Open vs invite-code registration per region at pilot start.
- Chat: in-app minimal thread (specced) vs just revealing phone numbers after
  accept (simpler, but leaks numbers). Current spec: in-app thread, phone reveal
  optional per user setting.
- Whether targeted join requests bypass the sequential-ask flow (currently: yes,
  a targeted request creates an ask for that driver directly).

## Deferred tech (parked, with triggers to revisit)

| Deferred | Revisit when |
| --- | --- |
| H3 hex prefilter | gross-match SQL > ~100 ms p95 |
| Materialized candidate views | per-event matching > ~1 s p95 |
| NATS / broker, multi-node API | single VPS saturated |
| MapLibre + self-hosted tiles | Google Maps key/cost pain |
| Driving detection (bluetooth/activity) | post-MVP, product pull exists |
| Live location sharing | post-MVP milestone 2 |
| Rust rewrite of hot paths | never, unless profiling proves need |

## Process notes

- grok CLI is currently broken (grok.com WS protocol change, `session.created`
  frames unparsed) — research fallback is WebSearch until grok-cli is fixed.
- Implementation plan: build on the mini PC; parallelize with Codex offload lanes
  (disjoint file scopes, tests as contract) per Harold's codex-offload workflow.
